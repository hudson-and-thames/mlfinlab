# Contributing to mlfinlab
First off we wanted to thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project. 

mlfinlab is an open source package based on the research of Dr Marcos Lopez de Prado in his new book
Advances in Financial Machine Learning. This implementation started out as a platform from which to base a masters research project on, [Masters in Financial Engineering at WorldQuant University](https://wqu.org/).

As we were working through the book we saw the opportunity to code up the implementations as well answer the 
questions at the back of every chapter. It has since evolved into a larger project with various implementations of machine learning in finance from various sources, such as the [Journal of Financial Data Science](https://jfds.pm-research.com/).

## Areas of Contribution
We have recently opened access to our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/mlfinlab/shared_invite/enQtOTUzNjAyNDI1NTc1LTU0NTczNWRlM2U5ZDZiZTUxNTgzNzBlNDU3YmY5MThkODdiMTgwNzI5NDQ2NWI0YTYyMmI3MjBkMzY2YjVkNzc) to help form a community and encourage contributions. 

Additionally we have started to create tickets on the [issues board](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues) and tagged them with the `good first issue` label to let the community know where we need help.

Needless to say, if you are interested in working on something not on the issues board, just drop us a slack message. We would be very excited to discuss this further with you.

Typical contributions are:
* Answering the questions at the back of a chapter in a Jupyter Notebook. [Research repo](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research)
* Adding new features and core functionality to the mlfinlab package. 
* Bug fixes
* Imporved documentaiton

## Templates
We have created [templates](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab/issues/new/choose) to help aid in creating issues and PRs:
* Bug report
* Feature request
* Custom issue template
* Pull Request Template
