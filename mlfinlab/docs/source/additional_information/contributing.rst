Areas of Contribution
=====================

Currently we have a `live project board`_ that follows the principles of Agile Project Management. This board is available to the public and lets everyone know what the maintainers are currently working on. The board has an ice bucket filled with new features and documentation that have priority.

Needless to say, if you are interested in working on something not on the project board, just drop us an email. We would be very excited to discuss this further.

The typical contributions are:

* Answering the questions at the back of a chapter in a Jupyter Notebook. `Research repo`_
* Adding new features and core functionality to the mlfinlab package.
