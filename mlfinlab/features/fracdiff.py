        The helper function generates weights that are used to compute fractionally
        differentiated series. It computes the weights that get used in the computation
        of  fractionally differentiated series. This generates a non-terminating series
        that approaches zero asymptotically. The side effect of this function is that
        it leads to negative drift "caused by an expanding window's added weights"
        (see page 83 AFML)

        When diff_amt is real (non-integer) positive number then it preserves memory.

        The book does not discuss what should be expected if d is a negative real
        number. Conceptually (from set theory) negative d leads to set of negative
        number of elements. And that translates into a set whose elements can be
        selected more than once or as many times as one chooses (multisets with
        unbounded multiplicity) - see http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/msri-up12.pdf.

        The helper function generates weights that are used to compute fractionally

        differentiated series.
        This makes the process more efficient. But the side-effect is that the
        fractionally differentiated series is skewed and has excess kurtosis. In
        other words, it is not Gaussian any more.
