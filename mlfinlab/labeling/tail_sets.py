    Tail set labels are a classification labeling technique introduced in the following paper: Nonlinear support vector
    machines can systematically identify stocks with high and low future returns. Algorithmic Finance, 2(1), pp.45-58.

    A tail set is defined to be a group of stocks whose volatility-adjusted price change is in the highest or lowest
    quantile, for example the highest or lowest 5%.

    A classification model is then fit using these labels to determine which stocks to buy and sell in a long / short
    portfolio.
