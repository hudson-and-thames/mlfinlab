    Function to run a cross-validation evaluation of the using sample weights and a custom CV generator.

    Note: This function is different to the book in that it requires the user to pass through a CV object. The book
    will accept a None value as a default and then resort to using PurgedCV, this also meant that extra arguments had to
    be passed to the function. To correct this we have removed the default and require the user to pass a CV object to
    the function.
