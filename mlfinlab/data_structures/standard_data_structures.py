Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Marcos Lopez de Prado
Chapter 2: Financial Data Structures

This module contains the functions to help users create structured financial data from raw unstructured data,
in the form of time, tick, volume, and dollar bars.

These bars are used throughout the text book (Advances in Financial Machine Learning, By Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2018,
pg 25) to build the more interesting features for predicting financial time series data.

These financial data structures have better statistical properties when compared to those based on fixed time interval
sampling. A great paper to read more about this is titled: The Volume Clock: Insights into the high frequency paradigm,
Lopez de Prado, et al.

Many of the projects going forward will require Dollar and Volume bars.
