    This class implements the Symmetric Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning strategy. It is
    reproduced with modification from the following paper:
    `Wang, Y., & Wang, D. (2019). Market Symmetry and Its Application to Pattern-Matching-Based
    Portfolio Selection. The Journal of Financial Data Science, 1(2), 78â€“92.
    <https://jfds.pm-research.com/content/1/2/78>`_

    Symmetric Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning is an extension of the CORN strategy
    proposed by Yang Wang and Dong Wang. SCORN looks to not only maximize the returns for the similar
    periods but also minimize the losses from the negatively correlated periods.
