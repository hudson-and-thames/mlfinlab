    Symmetric Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K formulates a number of SCORN experts and
    tracks the experts performance over time. Each period, the strategy decides to allocate capital
    to the top-k experts until the previous time period. This strategy takes an ensemble approach to
    the top performing experts.
