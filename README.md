MLFinLab is a python package based on the research of Dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado ([QuantResearch.org](http://www.quantresearch.org/)) in his new books
Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Machine Learning for Asset Managers, as well as various implementations from the [Journal of Financial Data Science](https://jfds.pm-research.com/). 
This implementation started out as a spring board for a research project in the [Masters in Financial Engineering programme at WorldQuant University](https://wqu.org/) and has grown into a mini research group called [Hudson and Thames Quantitative Research](https://hudsonthames.org/) (not affiliated with the university).

The following is the online documentation for the package: [read-the-docs](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
