MlFinlab is a python package which helps portfolio managers and traders who want to leverage the power of machine learning by providing reproducible, interpretable, and easy to use tools. 
Adding MlFinLab to your companies pipeline is like adding a department of PhD researchers to your team.

> **pip install mlfinlab**

We source all of our implementations from the most elite and peer-reviewed journals. Including publications from: 
1. [The Journal of Financial Data Science](https://jfds.pm-research.com/)
2. [The Journal of Portfolio Management](https://jpm.pm-research.com/)
3. [The Journal of Algorithmic Finance](http://www.algorithmicfinance.org/)
4. [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/)

We are making a big drive to include techniques from various authors, however the most dominant author would be Dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado ([QuantResearch.org](http://www.quantresearch.org/)).
This package has its foundations in the two graduate level textbooks: 
1. [Advances in Financial Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089)
2. [Machine Learning for Asset Managers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545)

## Unlocking the Commons
We are currently running a sponsorship model of “Unlocking the Commmons”. Our code base, online documentation, 
tutorial notebooks and presentations will remain open to everyone for so long as we can meet our minimum sponsorship 
goals. We have set the **deadline: December 2020** - for a monthly total patronage of $4000 USD.

Nadia Eghbal explains it well: “If you'd like to open source a project but want to ensure that others will invest in 
its long-term maintenance, you could tell your community that you'll open-source the project once you've hit a 
certain amount of sponsorship. (Writer Tim Carmody refers to this as "unlocking the commons.")”

and [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research), with code examples.

## Who is Hudson & Thames?
We are a private research group focused on implementing research based financial machine learning. We all work in 
virtual teams, spread across the world, primarily: New York, London, and Kyiv.
