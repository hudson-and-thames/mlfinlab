The Hudson & Thames `Mentorship Program`_ caters to ambitious students looking to make an impact on open-source and develop
a portfolio of work based on financial machine learning. You will learn a wealth of skills, with a focus on writing
production-level code, based on the most cutting edge research, from elite peer-reviewed journals, such as:

1. Journal of Financial Data Science
2. Journal of Portfolio Management
3. Algorithmic Finance

It is a powerful negotiating tool, when you can approach employers with an array of tools that can add immediate value to their company. To quote GitLab:

The program was established to help provide students with a guided path to gaining the Researcher achievement at
Hudson and Thames. Once the achievement has been unlocked you will gain lifetime access to our community, libraries,
and attribution for all of the work completed. As an optional service, we as a group share expenses for tools and
services such as high-quality tick data, journal subscriptions.

The goal of the program is to gain Researcher status. We will guide you through the following achievements:

1. Make a sizable contribution to the mlfinlab library.
2. Passed the following production-ready checks: code style and 100% test coverage.
3. Inline documentation, docstrings, and sphinx documentation.
4. Completed tutorial notebooks to show mastery of the concepts worked on and provide external users with guided documentation.
5. Long-form blog article (example) showcasing the newly implemented research. This gives researchers the opportunity to build
   on their online reputation and show off some of the new skills attained.
