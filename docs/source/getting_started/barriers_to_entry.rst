As most of you know, getting through the first 3 chapters of the book is challenging as it relies on HFT data to 
create the new financial data structures. Sourcing the HFT data is very difficult and thus we have resorted to purchasing the full history of S&P500 Emini futures tick data from `TickData LLC`_.

We are not affiliated with TickData in any way but would like to recommend others to make use of their service. The full history cost us about $750 and is worth every penny. They have really done a great job at cleaning the data and providing it in a user friendly manner.

Sample Data
===========

TickData does offer about 20 days worth of raw tick data which can be sourced from their website `link`_.

For those of you interested in working with a two years of sample tick, volume, and dollar bars, it is provided for in the `research repo`_.

You should be able to work on a few implementations of the code with this set.
