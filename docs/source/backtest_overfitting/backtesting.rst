   **Underlying Literature**

   The following sources elaborate extensively on the topic:

   - `Backtesting <https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract_id=2345489>`__ *by* Campbell R. Harvey *and* Yan Liu. *The paper provides a deeper understanding of the Haircut Sharpe ratio and Profit Hurdle algorithms. The code in this module is based on the code written by the researchers.*
   - `… and the Cross-section of Expected Returns. <https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P118_and_the_cross.PDF>`__ *by* Harvey, C.R., Y. Liu, and H. Zhu. *Describes a structural model to capture trading strategies’ underlying distribution, referred to as the HLZ model.*
   - `The Statistics of Sharpe Ratios. <https://alo.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Statistics-of-Sharpe-Ratios.pdf>`__ *by* Lo, A. *Gives a broader understanding of Sharpe ratio adjustments to autocorrelation and different time periods*
