Tail Sets
=========

Tail set labels are a classification labeling technique introduced in the following paper: `Huerta, R., Corbacho, F. and
Elkan, C., 2013. Nonlinear support vector machines can systematically identify stocks with high and low future returns.
Algorithmic Finance, 2(1), pp.45-58. <https://content.iospress.com/download/algorithmic-finance/af016?id=algorithmic-finance%2Faf016>`_

A tail set is defined to be a group of assets whose volatility-adjusted price change is in the highest or lowest
quantile, for example the highest or lowest 5%.

A classification model is then fit using these labels to determine which stocks to buy and sell, for a long / short
portfolio.

We label the y variable using the tail set labeling technique, which makes up the positive and negative (1, -1) classes
of the training data. The original paper investigates the performance of 3 types of metrics on which the tail sets are
built:

1. Real returns
2. Residual alpha after regression on the sector index
3. Volatility-adjusted returns

For our particular implementation, we have focused on the volatility-adjusted returns.

Metric: Volatility-Adjusted Returns
###################################

The formula for the volatility-adjusted returns are as follows:

.. math::

      r(t - t', t) = \frac{R(t-t',t)}{vol(t)}

Where :math:`R(t-t',t)` is the return for the asset, in our case we make use of daily (single period) returns, and
:math:`vol(t-1)` is a measure for volatility on daily returns. We provide two implementations for estimations of
volatility, first the exponential moving average of the mean absolute returns, and second the traditional standard
deviation. (The paper suggests a 180 day window period.)

To quote the paper: "Huffman and Moll (2011) show that risk measured as the mean absolute deviation has more explanatory
power for future expected returns than standard deviation."

Creating Tail Sets
##################

Once the volatility adjusted returns have been applied to the DataFrame of prices we then loop over each timestamp
and group the assets into deciles (10 groups). The upper and lower most deciles are labeled 1 and -1 respectively. These
then form part of the positive and negative tail sets.

Its important to note that we drop the 0 labels (for a given timestamp) and only train the model assets that made it into
the tail sets.

The following figure from the paper shows the distribution of the 91-day volatility-adjusted returns for the
industrials sector.

.. image:: labeling_images/var_distribution.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :align: center

"The positive tail sets are the 10% most positive volatility-adjusted returns, and the negative tail sets are the 10% most negative.
The vertical dotted lines represent the decile cut. The + and âˆ’ regions are the ones used for model training."


How to use these labels in practice?
####################################

The tail set labels from the code above returns the names of the assets which should be labeled with a positive or
negative label. Its important to note that the model you  would develop is a many to one model, in that it has many
x variables and only one y variable. The model is a binary classifier.

The model is trained on the training data and then used to score every security in the test data (on a given day).
Example: On December 1st 2019, the strategy needs to rebalance its positions, we score all 100 securities in our tradable
universe and then rank the outputs in a top down fashion. We form a long / short portfolio by going long the top 10
stocks and short the bottom 10 (equally weighted). We then hold the position to the next rebalance date.

The paper provides the following investment performance:

.. warning::
   The Tail Set labels are for the current day! In order to use them as a labeling technique you need to lag them so that
   they can be forward looking. We recommend using the pandas DataFrames ``df.lag(1)`` method.

Example
########
Below is an example on how to create the positive, negative, and full matrix Tail Sets.

.. code-block::

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from mlfinlab.labeling import TailSetLabels

    # Import price data
    data = pd.read_csv('../Sample-Data/stock_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

    # Create tail set labels
    labels = TailSetLabels(data, window=180, mean_abs_dev=True)
    pos_set, neg_set, matrix_set = labels.get_tail_sets()

    # Lag the labels to make them forward looking
    pos_set = pos_set.lag(1)
    neg_set = neg_set.lag(1)
    matrix_set = matrix_set.lag(1)
