============
Codependence
============

Pearson correlation coefficient is the most famous and widely used measure of codependence, however, there are some drawbacks.

.. warning::

    Pearson correlation suffers from 3 major drawbacks:

    1) It captures linear effects, but if two variables have strong non-linear dependency (squared or abs for example) Pearson correlation won't find any pattern between them.
    2) Correlation is not a distance metric: it does not satisfy non-negativity and subadditivity conditions.
    3) Financial market have non-linear patterns and correlations fails to capture them.

However, Pearson correlation is not the only way of measuring codependence. There are alternative and more modern measures of codependence, such
such as those introduced in information theory.


Correlation-Based Metrics
###########################

Distance Correlation
********************

**Distance Correlation** can capture not only linear association but also non-linear variable dependencies which Pearson correlation can not.
It was introduced in 2005 by Gábor J. Szekely. (`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_correlation>`_)

.. math::
    \rho_{dist}[X, Y] = \frac{dCov[X, Y]}{\sqrt{dCov[X, X]dCov[Y,Y}}

Where :math:`dCov[X, Y]` can be interpreted as the average Hadamard product of the doubly-centered Euclidean distance matrices of
:math:`X, Y`. (`Cornell lecture slides, p.7 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512994>`_)

Then

.. math::
    0 \leq \rho_{dist}[X, Y] \leq 1


| Unlike Pearson's correlation, when the value is zero, we can say the two variables are independent.

.. math::
    \rho_{dist}[X, Y] = 0 \Leftrightarrow X \perp Y


| As shown in the figure below, Distance Correlation captures the nonlinear relationship.

The numbers in the first line are Pearson correlation values and the values in the second line are Distance correlation values.
This figure is from `Introducing the discussion paper by Székely and Rizzo <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238879872_Introducing_the_discussion_paper_by_Szekely_and_Rizzo>`_

Angular Distance
*****************

**Angular Distance** is a slight modification of the correlation coefficient which satisfies all distance metric conditions.
This measure is known as the angular distance because when we use *covariance* as *inner product*, we can interpret correlation as :math:`cos\theta`.

It is a metric, because it is a linear multiple of the Euclidean distance between the vectors :math:`X, Y` (after standardization)
(`Cornell lecture slides, p.10 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512994>`_).

There are three types of angular distance: standard, absolute and squared.

Standard
========

   :alt: Angular Distance

   The angular distance satisfies all the conditions of a true metric, (Lopez de Prado, 2020.)


.. autofunction:: angular_distance

.. math::
    d_\rho[X, Y] = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(1-\rho[X,Y])}

.. math::
    d_\rho \in [0, 1]


Absolute and Squared
====================

.. figure:: codependence_images/modified_angular_distance.png
   :scale: 70 %
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center
   :alt: Modified Angular Distance

   In some financial applications, it makes more sense to apply a modified definition of angular distance, such that the
   sign of the correlation is ignored, (Lopez de Prado, 2020)

**Absolute**

.. math::
    d_{|\rho|}[X, Y] = \sqrt{1-|\rho[X,Y]|}

.. autofunction:: absolute_angular_distance

|

**Squared**

.. math::
    d_{\rho^2}[X, Y] = \sqrt{1-{\rho[X,Y]}^2}

.. autofunction:: squared_angular_distance

Information Theory Metrics
##########################

We can gauge the codependence from the information theory perspective. In information theory, (Shannon’s) entropy is a
measure of information (uncertainty).

.. math::
    H[X] = -\sum\limits_{x \in S_{X}}p[x]log[p[x]]

In short, we can say that entropy is the expectation of the amount of information when we sample from a particular probability distribution or the number of bits to transmit to the target.
So, If there is correspondence between random variables, the correspondence will be reflected in entropy. For example, if two random variables are associated,
the amount of information in the joint probability distribution of the two random variables will be less than the sum of the information in each random variable.
This is because knowing a correspondence means knowing one random variable can reduce uncertainty about the other random variable.

.. math::
    H[X+Y] = H[X] + H[Y],  X \bot Y


Here, we have two ways of measuring correspondence:

1. Mutual Information
2. Variation of Information


The following figure highlights how we can view the relationships of various information measures associated with correlated variables
:math:`X` and :math:`Y` through below figure. (`Cornell lecture slides, p.24 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512994>`_)

   :alt: Entropy Relational Diagram

   The correspondence between joint entropy, marginal entropies, conditional entropies, mutual information and variation of information (Lopez de Prado, 2020)

Mutual Information
******************

Mutual Information is defined as the decrease in uncertainty (or informational gain) in X that results from knowing the value of Y.
Mutual information is not a metric and needs to be normalized. (`Cornell lecture slides, p.18 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512994>`_)

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    I[X, Y]=& H[X] - H[X|Y]\\
           =& H[X]+H[Y]-H[X,Y]\\
           =& \sum\limits_{x \in S_{X}} \sum\limits_{y \in S_{Y}}p[x,y]log[\frac{p[x,y]}{p[x]p[y]}]\\
    \end{align*}

.. py:currentmodule:: mlfinlab.codependence.information

.. autofunction:: get_mutual_info


Variation of Information
************************

Variation of Information can be interpreted as the uncertainty we expect in one variable if we are told the value of another.
Variation of information is a metric because it satisfies non-negativity, symmetry, and triangle inequality axioms.

.. math::
   \begin{align*}
     VI[X,Y]=& H[X|Y] + H[Y|X]\\
           =& H[X] + H[Y]-2I[X,Y]\\
           =& 2H[X,Y]-H[X]-H[Y]\\
   \end{align*}

.. autofunction::  variation_of_information_score


Discretization
**************

Throughout the above section, we have assumed that random variables were discrete.

For the continuous case, we can quantize the values and estimate :math:`H[X]`, and apply the same concepts on the binned observations.
(`Cornell lecture slides, p.26 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3512994>`_)

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    H[X] =& \int_{\infty}^{\infty}f_{X}[x_{i}]logf_{X}[x]dx\\
    \:    &\approx-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{B_{X}}f_{X}[x_{i}]logf_{X}[x_{i}]\\
    \end{align*}

.. math::
    \hat{H}[X]=-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{B_{X}}\frac{N_{i}}{N}log[\frac{N_{i}}{N}]log[\Delta_{x}]

As you can see from these equations, we need to choose the binning carefully because results may be biased.
There are optimal binning  depends on entropy case(marginal, joint).
You can optimal number of bins for discretization through below method.
This function is need for using methods for getting information based codependence.
