Analytics

Please note that we have added standard web analytics to MLFinLab, using `Segment. <https://segment.com/>`__

We track the following:

* City
* UserIDs
* Function calls
* Timestamps

This allows our team to see how the package is being used by you, our client, so that we may improve the functionality and
build more tools that you will love. An additional purpose is that we need to start tracking growth KPIs such as cohort
retention and we will compile these into reports for investors, as we are aiming for VC funding in late 2021.

The impact of the analytics is negligible.

.. warning::

   * Please don't alter or change any of the code as this is a violation of our license agreement.
   * We do provide a separate enterprise license for companies that want to white label or alter code.
   * All changes are flagged by the system.
