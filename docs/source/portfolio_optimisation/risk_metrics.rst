Risk Metrics
============

The RiskMetrics class contains functions for calculation of common risk metrics used by investment professionals.
The list of supported metrics will grow with future updates of the package.

   |h4| Underlying Literature |h4_|

   The following sources elaborate extensively on the topic:

   - **Portfolio Optimization with Drawdown Constraints** *by* Alexei Chekhlov, Stanislav Uryasev, Michael Zabarankin `available here <https://www.ise.ufl.edu/uryasev/files/2011/11/drawdown.pdf>`_. *Introduces a CDaR measure and compares it to the CVaR measure.*


Supported Metrics
#################

Variance
********

This measure can be used to compare portfolios based on estimations of the volatility of returns.

The Variance of a portfolio is calculated as follows:

.. math::

      \sigma^{2} = w^{T}\sum w

where :math:`w` is the vector of weights for instruments in a portfolio, and :math:`\sum` is a covariance matrix of assets in a portfolio. Result :math:`\sigma^{2}` is a scalar.


Value at Risk (VaR)
*******************

This measure can be used to compare portfolios based on the amount of investments that can be lost in the next observation,
assuming the returns for assets follow a multivariate normal distribution.

The Value at Risk of a portfolio is calculated as follows:

.. math::

      VaR = Quantile_{\alpha}(R)

Where :math:`\alpha` is the confidence level to use, and the :math:`R` is a set of returns of a portfolio.

VaR of :math:`0.15` at :math:`\alpha = 0.05` level means that with a :math:`5\%` probability the portfolio will
decrease by :math:`15\%` on the next observation.

Expected Shortfall (CVaR)
*************************

This measure can be used to compare portfolios based on the average amount of investments that can be lost in a
worst-case scenario, assuming the returns for assets follow a multivariate normal distribution.

The Expected Shortfall of a portfolio is calculated as follows:

.. math::

      CVaR = E[{R, R < Quantile_{\alpha}(R)}]

Where :math:`\alpha` is the confidence level to use, and the :math:`R` is a set of returns of a portfolio.

CVaR of :math:`0.15` at :math:`\alpha = 0.05` level means that for :math:`5\%` worst cases of returns observations
the average loss of the portfolio value is :math:`15\%` per observation.

This picture from Y. Vardanyan demonstrates the differences between the VaR and the CVaR concepts:

Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)
***********************************

This measure can be used to compare portfolios based on the average amount of a portfolio drawdown in a
worst-case scenario, assuming the drawdowns follow a normal distribution.

The Expected Shortfall of a portfolio is calculated as follows:

.. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{align*}
      DD_{t} = max_{0 \le \tau \le t}\{w_{\tau}\} - w_{t}
      \end{align*}

      \begin{align*}
      CDaR = E[{DD_{t}, DD_{t} > Quantile_{\alpha}(DD)}]
      \end{align*}

Where :math:`\alpha` is the confidence level to use, :math:`w_{t}` is the price of a portfolio at time :math:`t`,
and :math:`DD_{t}` is the maximum historical drawdown up to time :math:`t` .

CDaR of :math:`0.15` at :math:`\alpha = 0.05` level means that for :math:`5\%` worst cases of historical portfolio drawdowns,
the average drawdown is :math:`0.15` units in which the portfolio price is measured.

.. tip::

    * This risk metric is described in more detail in the work **Portfolio Optimization with Drawdown Constraints** `available here <https://www.ise.ufl.edu/uryasev/files/2011/11/drawdown.pdf>`_.

    * VaR, CVaR and CDaR metrics can also be used for individual assets.

Implementation

    .. autoclass:: RiskMetrics
        :members:

        .. automethod:: __init__

Example Code
############
Below is an example of how to use the package functions to calculate risk metrics for a portfolio.

.. code-block::

    import pandas as pd
    from mlfinlab.portfolio_optimization import RiskMetrics

    # Import dataframe of returns for assets in a portfolio
    assets_returns = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH, index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

    # Calculate empirical covariance of assets
    assets_cov = assets_returns.cov()

    # Set weights for assets in a portfolio
    weights = [0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2]

    # Pick a confidence interval
    alpha = 0.05

    # Class that contains needed functions
    risk_met = RiskMetrics()

    # Calculate Variance
    Var = risk_met.calculate_variance(assets_cov, weights)

    # Calculate Value at Risk of the first asset
    VaR = risk_met.calculate_value_at_risk(assets_returns.iloc[:,0], alpha)

    # Calculate Expected Shortfall
    CVaR = risk_met.calculate_expected_shortfall(assets_returns.iloc[:,0], alpha)

    # Calculate Conditional Drawdown at Risk
    CDaR = risk_met.calculate_conditional_drawdown_risk(assets_returns.iloc[:,0], alpha)
