mlfinlab is an open source package based on the research of Dr Marcos Lopez de Prado in his new book
Advances in Financial Machine Learning. This implementation started out as a spring board for a research project in the `Masters in Financial Engineering programme at WorldQuant University`_ and has grown into a mini research group called Hudson and Thames (not affiliated with the university).

Notes
=====

mlfinlab is a living, breathing project, and new functionalities are consistently being added. 

The implementations that will be added in the future as well as the implementations that are currently supported can be seen below:

* Part 3: Backtesting
* Working on Chapter 16 (Aditya)
* Working on Chapter 10 (Lee)
